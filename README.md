# ArtificialNeuralNetworks_and_DeepLearning👨🏻‍🔧🧠
Hi, this is a simple repository for projects based on Artificial Neural Networks and Deep Learning 
In here you can find 2 challenges: 
- 1st Challenge on Image classification : we used various modelling techniques and we also tried GANS (not shown here) 
- 2nd Challenge on Blind Data analysis, meaning that we had NO CONTEXT on the type of data we were provided. Still we menaged to pull some good models out of them.
